            <p>I always was passionate about technology! When i was younger i thought how can i still challenge me, learning about how computers work and make money together, then i discovered software development. In my last job i was a Node.js developer and i was entrusted with fulfilling 80% of the project’s server-side tasks. I am excited to learn more and develop skills to become a specialist about what i love. During my missionary service, I developed strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills while helping and teaching people from different backgrounds. This experience strengthened my discipline, adaptability, and sense of purpose — qualities that now guide me as a developer when facing complex challenges and collaborating with teams to build meaningful solutions.</p>
